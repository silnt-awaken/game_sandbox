# game_sandbox

This is a personal repository where I will compile a variety of different game modes that I can apply to future games. This will be a skeletal version, to test logic and create new ideas.

# game modes in progress

- speed run (multiplayer)

# game modes in discussion

- protect the king
- turn based tdm
- secure flag
